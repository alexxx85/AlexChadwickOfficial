      <h3 class="block block1">
        Alex Chadwick is a Front-end developer, to the point where he nearly masters HTML and CSS!
      </h3>

      <h3 class="block block2">
        This is just an example website, so
        that people or companies interested in him can see what he can 
        achieve with only these 2 tools.
      </h3>

      <h3 class="block block3">
        But, he is currently learning 
        JavaScript, so he can start learning more advanced front-end and
        start to learn back-end (using NodeJS or jQuery).
      </h3>

      <h3 class="block block4">
        He is very passionate about learning new languages and really keen on coding these types of websites!
      </h3>

      <h3 class="block block5">
        Alex is a big fan of making simple, minimalistic, and functional one page websites,
        or he can do more pages, but he doesn't like exceeding from 5-6 pages.
